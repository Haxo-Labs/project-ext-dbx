# DBX Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

DBX is a lightweight, backend-agnostic database API server that exposes multiple database types through a unified interface. Built in Rust with pluggable adapters implementing the `UniversalBackend` trait, DBX provides consistent HTTP/WebSocket APIs regardless of the underlying database.

## Development Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Architecture & Redis Reference Implementation**
- Establish the backend trait system
- Complete Redis adapter as reference implementation
- Create comprehensive testing and documentation

**Phase 2: Production Deployment & Multi-Backend**
- Deploy production-ready version with Redis adapter
- Add MongoDB and PostgreSQL adapters
- Gather real-world usage feedback

**Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion**
- Add SQLite, DynamoDB, and Cassandra adapters
- Advanced features: authentication, monitoring, clustering
- Language bindings for Python, Go, Java
