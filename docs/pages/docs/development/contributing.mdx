# Contributing to DBX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DBX! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/effortlesslabs/dbx](https://github.com/effortlesslabs/dbx)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right
3. Clone your forked repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dbx.git
cd dbx
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the [Development Setup Guide](/docs/development) to get your environment ready.

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Rust Code

- Follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/naming/README.html)
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to check for common issues

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run clippy
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

#### TypeScript Code

- Follow the [TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Use ESLint for linting

```bash
cd bindings/redis_ts
npm run format
npm run lint
```

### Testing

Always write tests for your changes:

#### Rust Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

#### TypeScript Tests

```bash
cd bindings/redis_ts
npm test
```

#### Integration Tests

```bash
# Run full integration tests
./scripts/test-with-server.sh

# Run simple tests
./scripts/test-simple.sh
```

### Documentation
